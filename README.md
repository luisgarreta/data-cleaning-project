# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set with different measures taken from wearable devices from several subjects doing different activities.

The script reads the input files from the folder "inputs" and writes the output file into the working dir. The output file is saved in two formats: .txt and .csv.

The main steps implemented in the script are:

- Step 0: Read input data 
- Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set 
- Step 2. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
- Step 3: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
- Step 4: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The codebook describing the output file from the cleaning process is in the file named "Codebook.txt"
